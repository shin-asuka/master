	<p>Dear {{teacherName}}, </p>

	<p>
		Thank you for taking the time to participate in the VIPKID interview. 
		<strong>Unfortunately at this stage we are not progressing with your application</strong>. 
		We feel that while your qualifications are still great, you may not be a good fit for our online classrooms. 
	</p>
	
	<P>
		We would like to remind you that online education is a new and still emerging industry, and the needs of students in this environment are quite different. 
	</P>
	
	<P>
		If you are still interested, we encourage you to learn more about the industry. There are some great online courses available too. Who knows, maybe we'll see your application again in 3 months time (we hope so!). 
	</P>

	<p>
		Best Regards,<br/><br/>VIPKID Recruitment Team
