	<p>Dear {{teacherName}},</p>
	
	<p>Don't forget you have your interview with VIPKID scheduled at:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li><p><strong>Time:</strong> {{scheduledDateTime}}</p></li>
		<li><p><strong>Time Zone:</strong> {{timezone}}</p></li>
		<li><p><strong>Where:</strong> <a href="https://t.vipkid.com.cn/login" target="_blank">t.vipkid.com.cn/login</a></p></li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>
		Make sure you're aware of the time zone (we're in China remember). If you think you will have any trouble making the interview, or are experiencing any other issues, please let us know. 
	</p>
	
	<p>To make sure you're on time and well prepared, remember:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Your interview will take place directly in our portal (see above)</li>
		<li>Make sure you check out the <a href="https://resource.vipkid.com.cn/teacher_recruitment/step2_interview/InterviewTips.pdf" download="pdf">interview tips</a> and <a href="https://resource.vipkid.com.cn/teacher_recruitment/step2_interview/interview_demo.pdf" download="pdf">demo ppt</a> beforehand (so important)</li>
		<li>Make sure you're using a desktop or laptop computer (phones/iPads won't work)</li>
		<li>Make sure you're on time!</li>
		<li>If you need to cancel, you'll only have one opportunity to do so</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>Since we enjoy IT issues about as much as pulling teeth (you're probably the same), we have provided some tips to ensure the process goes smoothly:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Clear your web browser cache</li>
		<li>Use Chrome as the preferred web browser</li>
		<li>Use a wired connection (instead of wifi) if your connection is unstable</li>
		<li>If all else fails, restart (and maybe kick) your computer</li>
		<li>Don't really kick your computer, the lawyer says we could get in trouble</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>
		Remember you can always email us at <a href="mailto:teachvip@vipkid.com.cn">teachvip@vipkid.com.cn</a> for any issues. Also, you can find instructions on entering the classroom <a href="https://resource.vipkid.com.cn/teacher_recruitment/step2_interview/Tech_Guide-Enter_Interview_Classroom.pptx" download="pptx">here</a>.

	<p>We look forward to seeing you (don't worry, sweaty palms don't show on camera... ours not yours). </p>


	<p>Best Regards.<br><br>VIPKID Recruitment Team</p>
