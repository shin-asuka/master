<p>Dear {{teacherName}},</p>

<p>We’ve noticed that you are still in the Mock Class stage, and so we would like to check in with you to make sure you aren’t having any issues that are preventing you from finishing the process and joining the active roster.</p>

<p>You have 6 days from the time you complete the teaching prep stage to finish the Mock Class stage.</p>

<p>Should you require any technical or other assistance, please let us know at <a href="mailto:teachvip@vipkid.com.cn">teachvip@vipkid.com.cn</a> so that we do not prematurely remove you from the process and can help troubleshoot or accommodate your needs.</p>

<p>Best Regards,</p>

<p>VIPKID Recruitment Team</p>
