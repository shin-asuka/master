    <p>Dear {{teacherName}},</p>

    <p>Don't forget your Mock Class is coming up. Our mentors have been talking about you all day!</p>

    <p><b>When: {{scheduledDateTime}}</b></p>

    <p><b>Time zone: {{timezone}}</b></p>

    <p><b>At: <a href="https://t.vipkid.com.cn/login" target="_blank"> t.vipkid.com.cn/login.</a></b></p>

    <p>Check out the <a style="color: blue" href="https://resource.vipkid.com.cn/teacher_recruitment/step2_interview/Mock_Class_FAQ.pdf" download="Mock_Class_FAQs.pptx">Mock Class FAQs</a> for more helpful tips about the class.</p>
    <p>Our mock classes are in high demand, so if you need to cancel please do so 24 hours prior to the class if possible. We might cry, we'll definitely sniffle a bit, but we can also ensure another applicant can take your spot.</p>

    <p style ="color:red;"><I>If you cannot keep the Mock Class appointment as scheduled, please cancel it now.</I></p>

    <p style='font-size:14px;'><i>*Cancellations must be received at least 6 hours before the scheduled appointment time.
        When you fail to cancel your Mock Class in a timely fashion or do not appear for your appointment, your actions reflect poorly on your as an individual and on the platform as a whole.
        Not only do you inconvenience the Mentor, but you may also deprive another teacher of a valuable Mock Class opportunity. Fail to show up for a Mock Class (no-show), the Teacher Management Team will treat this instance seriously and will enforce "a two strikes and you're out" system.
