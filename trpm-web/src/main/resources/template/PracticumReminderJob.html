<p>Don’t forget your Mock Class is coming up. Our mentors have been talking about you all day!</p>
<p><b>When: {{scheduledDateTime}}</b></p>
<p><b>Time zone: {{timezone}}</b></p>
<p><b>At: <a href="https://t.vipkid.com.cn/login" target="_blank"> t.vipkid.com.cn/login.</a></b></p>
<p>Check out the <a style="color: red" href="https://resource.vipkid.com.cn/teacher_recruitment/step2_interview/Mock_Class_FAQ.pdf" download="Mock_Class_FAQs.pptx">Mock Class FAQs</a> for more helpful tips about the class.</p>
<p>Our mock classes are in high demand, so if you need to cancel please do so 24 hours prior to the class if possible. We might cry, we’ll definitely sniffle a bit, but we can also ensure another applicant can take your spot.</p>
<p>Please note that by not showing up for a mock class, your account may be deactivated.</p>
<p>If you have any trouble connecting to the “mock class”, we can also communicate through Skype. Make sure you add our Skype, which is <b>vipkid.mockclass</b>. Also, you can contact us anytime at <a href="mailto:teachvip@vipkid.com.cn">teachvip@vipkid.com.cn</a></p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>The VIPKID Recruitment Team</p>
